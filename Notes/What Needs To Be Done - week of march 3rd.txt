- right angle brackets need shaving
- connect linear translator to extrusion crossbar
	- need some sort of male to male m5 connector to mount together
	- M5 Double ended stud bolts
- machine holes in syringe pump to connect to linear translator
- screw (female) to put on chuck for spinning platform

Software:
- write testing code for each of the components
- go over how to control syringe pump with Arduino
